************What is Operating System*************

1960 - the software that controls the hardware.
today - Today's hardware execute a variety of software applications. To increase hardware utilization, applications
	are designed to execute concurrently. If these applications are not carefully programmed, they might 
	interfere with one another. As a result, a layer of software called an OPERATING SYSTEM separates 
	applications from the hardware they access and provides services that allow each application to
	execute safely and effectively.

The software that contains core components of the operating system is called kernel.

OS can be found in devices ranging from cell phones , automobiles to personal and mainframe computers.
In most computer system, user requests that the computer perform an action and the OS manages the software and 
hardware to produce the desired result.

OS are primarily resourse managers - they manage hardware , including processors, memory, i/o devices and 
communication devices.

1.	Do OS manage only hardware ?
ans.    No, OS manage applications and other software abstractions, such as virtual machines.

2.	What are primary purpose of an OS?
ans.	enable application to interact with a computer's hardware
	manage system's hardware and software resourses

*****************History*****************

1940  - No OS, machine lang. programs one bit at a time on rows of mechanical switches
then, - assembly languages - used english like abbreviations to represent the basic operations of the computer
	developed to speed the programming process.
1950s - for IBM 701 computer introduced first OS, which executed only one job at a time, using techniques that smoothed transition
	between jobs to obtain maximum utilization of the computer system.  
	These early computers are called single stream batch processing systems, because programs and data were submitted in groups
 	or batches by loading them consecutively onto tape or disk. A job stream processor read the job control statements(that defined
	the job) and facilitated the setup of the next job.delays and all.
1960s - also batch processing, but efficient by running several jobs at once.Improved resource utilization by allowing one job to use the
	processor while other jobs used peripheral devices.Multiprogramming - managed several job at once. A system's degree of multi-
	programming indicates how many jobs can be managed at once.
	Multiple interactive users at once. Timesharing systems were developed to support simultaneous interactive users.
	
	Real-time systems attempt to supply a response time within a certain bounded time period.Example - a measurement from a petroleum 
	refinery indicating that temperatures are too high might demand immediate attention to avert an explosion. The resources of a real 
	time system are often highly underutilized- it is more important for such systems to respond quickly than it is for them to use their
	resources efficiently.
 	
	CTSS(compatible time sharing system) by MIT, TSS(time sharing system) by IBM, Multics by MIT, CP/CMS(Control program/Conversational
	monitor system) which eventually evolved into IBM's VM(virtual machine).

	The designers of Multics were first to use 'Process' to describe a program in execution.
