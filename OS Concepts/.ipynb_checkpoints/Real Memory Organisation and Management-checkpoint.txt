*************Real Memory <==> Physical Memory************

Secondary Storage -- most commonly disk and tape - provides massive, inexpensive capacity for the abundance of programs and data 
		     that must be readily available for processing. It is however, slow and not directly accessible to processors.
		     
		     To be run or referenced directly, programs and data must be in main memory.

		     Some systems, such as certain types of real time and embedded systems, cannot afford the overhead of the concepts
		     of virtual memory - so to them real memory remains crucial.
