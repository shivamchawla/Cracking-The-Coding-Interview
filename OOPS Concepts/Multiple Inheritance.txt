Multiple Inheritance -- 
	Multiple inheritance is when there is more than one parent class.
Example -- 
	class Dinosaur:
		def __init__(self, size, weight):
			self.size = size
			self.weight = weight

	class Carnivore:
		def __init__(self, diet):
			self.diet = diet 

	class Tyrannosaurus(Dinosaur, Carnivore):
		pass
	#Multiple Inherited
tiny = Tyrannosaurus(12, 14, "whatever it wants")

What went wrong!?
In multiple inheritance, there are two __init__ methods (one from each parent) that the class Tyrannosaurus 
inherits. Python is not sure how to take the list of parameters for tiny and divide them between two __init__
methods. That is why you saw an error message when you ran your code.

try this -- 
tiny = Tyrannosaurus(12, 14)
print(tiny.size)

Whoo hoo, it works!! . 
The Tyrannosaurus class inherits from two classes. One parent has two parameters for its constructor, while other
has one parameter. Python throws an error when three parameters are passed to Tyrannosaurus, but runs just fine 
when two parameters are passed. Look at it , how Tyrannosaurus class was defined!

	class Tyrannosaurus(Dinosaur, Carnivore):
		pass

Dinosaur is listed as the first parent class, so python uses the construtor from the Dinosaur class. Since 
dinosaur takes two parameters, the Tyrannosaurus class works with two parameters!.


In order to have access to attributes from all the parent classes, you need to override the __init__ method of 
the child class.

The below code doesnot work as python doesnt know if super() is referring to Dinosaur class or the Carnivore class.
		class Tyrannosaurus(Dinosaur, Carnivore):
			def __init__(self, size, weight, diet):
				super().__init__(size, weight)
				super().__init__(diet)

Overriding the __init__ method for parent class requires a unique structure. Instead of super() use the name of 
the class. You must pass self to the parent __init__ method.

		class Tyrannosaurus(Dinosaur, Carnivore):
			def __init__(self, size, weight, diet):
				Dinosaur.__init__(self, size, weight)
				Carnivore.__init__(self, diet)
