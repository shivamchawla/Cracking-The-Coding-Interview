Validation:
    Testing is an example of a more general process called validation. The purpose of validation is to uncover problems in a program and thereby increase your confidence in the program's correctness.
    Validation includes:
        Formal reasoning about the program, usually called verification. Verification constructs a formal proof that a program is correct. Verification is tedious to do by hand, and automated tool support for verification is still an active area of research. Nevertheless, small, crucial pieces of a program may be formally verified, such as the scheduler in an operating system, or the bytecode interpreter in a virtual machine, or the filesystem in an operating system.
        Code review. Havinf somebody else carefully read your code and reason informally about it, can be a good way to uncover bugs. It's much like having somebody else proofread an essay you have written.
        Testing. Running the program on carefully selected inputs and checking the results
    Even with the best validation, it's very hard to achieve perfect quality in software
    
    residual defect rates(bugs left over after the software has shipped) (defects/kloc)(one thousand lines of source code)
